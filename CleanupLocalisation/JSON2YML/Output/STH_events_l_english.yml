The message is a single repeated word: '[From.From.GetName]'. \n\nThe source of the signal is does not return the ship's hails directly, however a brilliant white light appears to pass through apparently in response. \n\nAlmost immediately the crew begin to notice the ship growing around them, until instrument checks confirm it is they instead who have begun to shrink. The science officer surmises that at the current rate of shrinkage the ship will be inoperable within a day. \n\nThe [Root.GetFleetName] breaks orbit and prepares to enter warp. Still shrinking, Captain [Root.GetLeaderName] surmises that withdrawing from the system will halt or reverse the process, giving the scientists at home time to research the matter more thoroughly. As the warp coils begin to power up the chief Engineer notices a slight phase imbalance in the plasma flow regulators, but dismisses it. As the ship breaks the warp barrier the phase imbalance escalates, ripping a hole in the starboard warp coil. The ship is torn apart, killing all hands."

As the affected continue to descend into madness and violence, the Science officer orders their sedation. Medical supplies run low, and eventually the stun setting on their weapons is the only option available. \n\nThe crew on the [Root.GetFleetName] surmise that a cure might be found by investigating the local animal life, in particular a large insect that appears connected with the flower producing the pollen affecting the crew. The Science and Security officers both begin to search for a specimen to capture. Coming across a nest of the creatures, they attempt to place a containment net around it. This enrages several of the nearby insects which sting the pair several times before being fought off with weapons fire. \n\nBoth quickly begin to weaken, as the poison in the insects' stings spread through them. They fall to the ground in pain and after several agonising minutes both die from complete organ failure. \n\nThe pollen affected crew begin to wake from their sedation, but several have already begun to fall ill. Without further data from the surface the medical team on the [Root.GetFleetName] are unable to progress in the development of the cure, and after several days all on the surface are dead. \n\n[From.From.GetName] is recorded as notionally habitable, but requiring significant study before colonisation can begin."
