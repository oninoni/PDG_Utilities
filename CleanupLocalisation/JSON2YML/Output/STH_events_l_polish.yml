This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps the temperature very hot, regardless of the planet’s distance from the sun. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet “dies” and becomes a class C world – with a few rare cases that transform into Q-geothermal planets.
