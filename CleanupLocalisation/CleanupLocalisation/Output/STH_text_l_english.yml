 pc_class_q_geo:0 "Class Q (Geothermal)"
 pc_class_q_geo_desc:0 "Somewhat more frequent than their Q-variable brothers, Q-geothermal class planets also have an incredibly varied collection of biomes. Q-variables are often C or P planets that still have a highly active core, and their thermal vents melt glaciers and allow for a local pocket of heat and life to flourish."

 pc_r_class:0 "Class R (Rogue)"
 pc_r_class_desc:0 "Every class R planet began its life as a normal world, probably a M-Class planet. However, as some point of its evolution, the planet was violently ejected from its orbit – most likely when a stellar mass crossed near the solar system, millennia ago.

 pc_r_class_habitability:1 "Rogue-planet Habitability"
 pc_f_class:0 "Class F (Geocrystalline)"
 pc_f_class_desc:0 "As a class-E world cools, the curst and core solidify and the planet becomes class F. These worlds witness much geological activity; steam expelled from volcanic eruptions condenses into water, and forms the first shallow seas and bolsters the atmosphere with water vapor. In those tumulus mud baths and seas, abiogenesis kick starts the very first life. Bacteria may develop and ultimately, thrive. As the planet cools further and volcanic activity lessens, the planet eventually transition to class G."

 pc_y_class_habitability:1 "Demon-planet Habitability"
 pc_molten:0 "Class A (Geoactive)"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "Class A-Geoactive planets are generally small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity. This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect that keeps the temperature very hot, regardless of the planet’s distance from the sun. When the volcanic activity eventually ceases, the planet “dies” and becomes a class C world – with a few rare cases that transform into Q-geothermal planets. Until that happens, the toxic levels of carbon dioxide makes this planet unsuitable to any known life form, but silicon-based life may just be able to terraform it to their needs."
 pc_class_d_barren:0 "Class D (Barren)"
 pc_class_d_barren_desc:0 "Class D dwarf planets are tiny worlds that generally do not meet the criteria for other planetary designations – this category include moons, asteroids and other small planet-like objects. The D-Barren dwarf planet, despite being tiny, is still capable of holding a basic atmosphere and basic living conditions."
 pc_class_e:0 "Class E (Geoplastic)"
 pc_class_e_desc:0 "Class E worlds represent the earliest stage in the formation of a new planet. The core and crust are still completely molten, making the planet susceptible to solar winds and radiation, and subject to extremely high surface temperatures. The atmosphere is very thin, and composed usually of light gases such as hydrogen and helium that escaped from the surface. As the planet cools, the core and crust begins to harden and the planet becomes class F. Only the most intensive terraforming techniques may hope to make any use of this planet."

 pc_gaia_habitability:1 "Gaia Habitability"
 pc_b_class:0 "Class B (Geomorteus)"
 pc_b_class_desc:0 "Class B-Geomorteus are small, rocky worlds located within a star system’s hot zone. Unsuitable for any form of life, Geomorteus planets have a highly unstable, molten surface. The thin atmosphere composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450 Celsius; because there is little atmosphere to retain the heat, it can get as cold as -200 Celsius at night. Without a significant atmosphere, no life form has any hope of colonizing class-B planets, or even terraforming them."
 pc_barren_cold:0 "Class C (Geoinactive)"
 pc_barren_cold_desc:0 "When all activity on a class-A world ceases, the planet is then considered class C. Essentially dead, these small, rocky worlds have a cold, barren surface. As their core cooled down, their rotation slowed and eventually their atmosphere dissipated. No life form has any use for these planets, although they do often possess rich mineral deposits from their volcanic-active past."
 pc_asteroid:0 "Class D (Asteroid)"

 pc_a_star_desc:0 "These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants."
 pc_b_star:0 "Class B Star"
 pc_b_star_desc:0 "The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye."
 pc_f_star:0 "Class F star"
 pc_f_star_desc:0 "F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds."
 pc_g_star:0 "Class G Star"
 pc_g_star_desc:0 "Often referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life."
 pc_k_star:0 "Class K Star"
 pc_k_star_desc:0 "These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life."
 pc_m_star:0 "Class M Star"
 pc_m_star_desc:0 "The most common stars in the universe, they are often referred to as red dwarves and some are as old as the galaxy. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life."
 pc_black_hole:0 "Black Hole"
 pc_black_hole_desc:0 "Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, usually at least five times the mass of Sol. Black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed."
 pc_neutron_star:0 "Neutron Star"
 pc_neutron_star_desc:0 "These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star, but not massive enough to result in a black hole, suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star."
 pc_pulsar:0 "Pulsar"
 pc_pulsar_desc:0 "Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy."

 START_SCREEN_UFP:0 "The spectre of war had followed Humanity for centuries, culminating in the Third World War in 2053. Emerging from this post-atomic horror, the people of Earth struggled to survive until the scientist Zefram Cochrane successfully drew the attention of the Vulcan science vessel T'planna Hath a decade later.\n\nFollowing almost a century of Vulcan patronage, the people of Earth are ready to take their first steps into the Great Unknown.\n\nTo seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no one has gone before."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_KlingonEmpire_desc:0 "The Klingons are a humanoid warrior species from the planet Qo'noS. Distinctive for their head ridges and dark complexions, the Klingons are also known far and wide for their strength and aggressiveness who value honor and tradition.\n\nHistorically the Klingons were first united as one under Kahless the Unforgettable over 1100 years ago, and the warrior culture has only grown since then.\n\nThe aggressiveness of the Klingon people generally leads to poor relations with other races, and a need to conquer and expand as resources are used up."
 START_SCREEN_KDF:0 "With fire and steel did the gods forge the Klingon heart. So fiercely did it beat, so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out, 'On this day we have brought forth the strongest heart in all the heavens. None can stand before it without trembling at its strength.'\n\nThe Klingon Empire, led by the illustrious example of Kahless the Unforgettable, stands stronger than ever before. We control numerous worlds and many more worlds await our glorious armies. How many worthy foes are out there for our warriors to battle? Under the leadership of our Chancellor and the High Council, we shall find out.\n\nMay you bring glory to your House and to the Empire! Qapla'!"

 START_SCREEN_ROM:0 "It has been more than 1,500 years since our ancestors left Vulcan, our original homeworld, to escape the poisonous ideology of Surak and his followers.\n\nAfter a long journey, we found a perfect system to settle. We were no longer Vulcans, we were Romulans, prouder than ever before. We have founded our Star Empire to protect our values. And we eventually did prove Surak wrong.\n\nOur Empire has grown far more powerful and far more secure than Surak's Vulcan could ever hope to be.\n\nBut we must not underestimate our enemies. We must remain vigilant. Our Senate and our Praetor must always choose the best course of action to protect all Romulans.\n\nWe shall never yield. Never!"

 START_SCREEN_CAR:0 "The beginnings our now mighty empire were not easy. Under the foolish rule of the civilian government, our people suffered. We starved by the millions. It was only when the military took charge that the situation improved.\n\nWe were able to feed our people. We finally realized that it was not the liberty or freedom of the individual that mattered, but the good of all of Cardassia. We all reflect this truth when we put our families and Cardassia above our personal interests.\n\nAnd so, assisted by this philosophy, may a glorious empire rise from the sands and dry valleys of Cardassia Prime, an empire destined to bring well-being to all Cardassians.\n\nFor Cardassia!"

Given that most known humanoid species lived on class M planets with an average temperature far above the supposed temperature of Breen, the Breen were largely thought to have had to develop refrigeration suits in order to co-exist with others.\n\nThe Breen are known to use slave labour of lesser races in their mines and construction programs"
 START_SCREEN_BRE:0 "Not even we ourselves know precisely how our civilization came to be, but one thing is for certain - we have never let anything disrupt the unity we have achieved.

Now, with the purchase of warp drive technology, we are living in a time of perhaps the greatest business opportunity any Ferengi generation has ever seen.

 START_SCREEN_VUL:0 "Many may resent our ways, perhaps finding them to be too stoic and overly logical, but our history teaches us differently.\n\nBefore the Time of Awakening, we were a violent, hateful race, which almost drove itself to extinction. The adoption of Surak's philosophy of logic over 1,700 years ago finally put an end to our undisciplined past.\n\nNow, when we are beginning to explore the galaxy, may we stay true to Surak's example and maintain our way of life even when confronted with others who may not share our dedication to logic and purposefulness."

Kumari remains the most prestigious name for an Imperial Guard vessel to this day.\n\nNow we are ready for a new step forward. The galaxy itself awaits us.

 START_SCREEN_BAJ:0 "Bajor has had a flourishing civilization for at least half a million years now.\n\nWe are accomplished in science, mathematics, philosophy and the arts, all led by the guidance of our beloved Prophets. Our faith in them was further strengthened by the appearance of their Orbs.\n\nWe achieved advanced space travel around 600 years ago with the first sailships, light vessels powered by solar wind. We even visited some of the neighbouring star systems using tachyon anomalies. But this form of interstellar travel was highly unreliable and dangerous.
