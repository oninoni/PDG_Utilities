#  This is a guide for using the Localisation Creators made for Stellaris  #

##########
# Step 1 #
##########

Copy the content of your vanilla \localisation into the 'VanillaFiles' folder of the Localisation Creator you need.

############
## Step 2 ## 
############

Export ALL the localisation google spreadsheets (of the mod you want to localise) via the plugin called 'Export Sheet Data' (Spreadsheets are e.g. Main Localisation, Event Localisation etc.)
(Link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-sheet-data/bfdcopkbamihhchdnjghdknibmcnfplk?utm_source=permalink) 

Usually it automatically puts in the right settings. If e.g. there are no check boxes ticked, please contact Zoom. 
Because every sheet needs it's own unique settings it would be too much work to list all of them here :P

##############
### Step 3 ### 
##############

Put the exported .JSON files into the 'Input' folder of the Localisation Creator you need.

################
#### Step 4 ####
################

Start the .bat file in the main folder. A cmd window should pop up and start transforming the .JSON data into .yml data.
Wait until it says 'Done!' and close the window afterwards.

###################
###### Step 5 #####
###################

Your newly generated files are now located in the 'Output' folder. Just take those files and put them into the /localisation or /localisation_synced folder of the mod you want to localise.

IMPORTANT!

ALWAYS delete the content of the mods localisation before your copy the newly generated stuff in there!
