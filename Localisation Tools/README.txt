##########
# Step 1 #
##########

IGNORE THE 'Source' FOLDER
Copy the content of your vanilla \localisation into the 'VanillaFiles' folder of the Localisation Creator you need.

############
## Step 2 ## 
############

Export ALL the localisation google spreadsheets (of the mod you want to localise) via the add-on called 'Export Sheet Data' (Spreadsheets are e.g. Main Localisation, Event Localisation etc.)
(After you've installed the add-on, navigate to a spreadsheet of your choice, then click on Add-ons (Tab in the Top Bar) -> Export Sheet Data -> Open Sidebar)
(Link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-sheet-data/bfdcopkbamihhchdnjghdknibmcnfplk?utm_source=permalink) 

Usually it automatically puts in the right settings. If e.g. there are no check boxes ticked, please contact Zoom. 
Because every sheet needs its own unique settings it would be too much work to list all of them here :P

##############
### Step 3 ### 
##############

Put the exported .JSON files in the 'Input' folder of the Localisation Creator you need.
(Don't worry, the deutschkorrektur_l_german.yml in there is where it should be.)

################
#### Step 4 ####
################

Start the ENGAGE.bat file in the main folder. A cmd window should pop up and start transforming the .JSON data into .yml data.
Wait until it says 'Done!' and close the window afterwards.

###################
###### Step 5 #####
###################

Your newly generated files are now located in the 'Output' folder. Just take those files and put them into the /localisation or /localisation_synced folder of the mod you want to localise.

IMPORTANT!

ALWAYS delete the content of the mods localisation before you copy the newly generated stuff in there!
